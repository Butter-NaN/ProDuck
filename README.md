# Produck
A Google Chrome extension that helps you manage your tabs when you're working or playing.

## What it aims to do
1. Allows tabs to be categorised as work related or recreational related. 
2. Manages recreational tabs by pinning them to the side, when it is time for work (and vice versa)
3. Supports a timer that aids to start and stop work-rest cycles.

## Our belief
We want continual development of this project, but we are busy university students drowning in homework and readings.
If you would like to create an issue, or better yet, solve one, please do so!
