# Hack & Roll 2018

## Workflow
Let's go with a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for now. Discourse welcome. For convenience, simple commits can bypass branch-creation and go straight to master.

An example of a [good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).

## Ideas
1. Webapp that helps diners split the bill. Preferably a static page, users add dishes one by one, indicating who ordered that dish. Settings such as session and dish %-multiplier (for GSTs, discount) available. Requires javascript, html, CSS know-how. Perhaps sessions may be stored in cookies.
2. Inspired by commitbait (https://github.com/yangshun/commitbait). Script that takes a commit message and contextually makes it clickbait-y (e.g "add Home controlleer" >> "You'll never believe what adding a Home controller did!")
3. Chrome extension that replaces ads with stuff you want
    1. Pictures of cats from static db
    2. Pictures of cats from reddit
    3. Motivational quotes
    4. Items from to-do list
    5. Words of the day
    6. Auto-block sound-playing side elements?
    7. learn a language (import from flashcards)
4. Delete hyperlinks or distractions on a page
5. Calculate bandwidth and cut off after a certain point
6. Pomodoro browser switcher: Keep switching away from work tabs. Strict mode vs lenient mode.
