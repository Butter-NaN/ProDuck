## Workflow
Let's go with a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for now. Discourse welcome. For convenience, simple commits can bypass branch-creation and go straight to master.

An example of a [good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).

## Ideas
1. Webapp that helps diners split the bill. Preferably a static page, users add dishes one by one, indicating who ordered that dish. Settings such as session and dish %-multiplier (for GSTs, discount) available. Requires javascript, html, CSS know-how. Perhaps sessions may be stored in cookies.
